#summary The current process applied to deciding on and updating the InstaUp2Date catalogs
= Legwork =

  # Restore the BaseOScache file per build(10.5.6, 10.6.3, 10.7.0 and newest Lion from the MacAppStore)
  # Boot with no packages added/workflows applied(i.e., don't use deploystudio, just asr at the command line or Disk Utility) and run the GUI Software Update application(from the Apple menu or /System/Library/CoreServices/Software Update.app) manually, installing all offered updates.
  # Search/grep the install.log for the order in which the packages are applied(only 10.5 had a SoftwareUpdate log, but 'installed' is a good keyword to cut through the chaff)
  # Rinse and repeat until gui swupdate returns no packages

= Putting it together =

Then, after finding the updates on support.apple.com/downloads (or in the case of Safari and iTunes, download from their respective pages and right-click the entry in the downloads window and get the URL via Copy Address), checksum them (we recommend using the instadmg/AddOns/InstaUp2Date/checksum.py tool) and clean up the first field generated, the name, to make it more friendly/obvious.  Two other things of note: 
  * remove any superfluous (hardware/accessory-specific, e.g. EFI/firmware/thunderbolt) updates and 
  * check iLife updates with the same GUI manner on the most popular version of the OS (still Snow Leo as of this writing)

Feel free to post your results to the AFP548 forum, or the instadmg-dev mailing list, or Twitter with #instadmg or #instaUp2Date

Thanks!
