* karl.kuehn: Re-do the dmg mounting portion to allow for multiple dmg's to be mounted and for individual pkg's to be used from them with their own installerchoices files. Possibly do this with a single "union" mount to make the multiple DVD's look like one disk and be able to hide it from the finder.
